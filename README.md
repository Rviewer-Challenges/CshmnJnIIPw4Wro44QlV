# Unit Converter APP

Have you ever tried creating your own unit converter? Yes, an app with which you can instantly transform units. Weight,
temperature, time, length, power, currency... And many more!

When we think of these apps, the typical conversion app comes to mind: from Euros to Dollars, from degrees Celsius to
Fahrenheit, from Kilometers to Miles... But we can also make more complex transformations between various measurement
systems.

The goal of this challenge is that you can create your own app to convert units. You‚Äôll decide the level of difficulty
and complexity, your imagination will be the limit!

## What you'll create

### General level:

- This test is designed for all levels. You can create something very simple (i.e. an app that transforms
  units in a system), or something more fancy like an application that transforms between systems and that is not
  only focused on one type of unit.
- Different types of units have been mentioned, but you decide what to make the project about (it can be about units
  that have not been mentioned, there are infinite...). The decision is yours!
- Conversions must be able to be done in any direction, that is, if the project supports meters, decimeters, centimeters
  and millimeters, the app must cover all possible combinations of conversion.
- The use of the app should be as simple as possible. This is the real challenge of this exercise, if I want to do a
  transformation it has to be something very fast and easy!

### Screens

- If your app allows to transform many types of units, it must have a selection screen and a detail screen with the
  converter.
- If you decide that your application only supports one family of units, it can be all in one screen.

> I remind you that you should work on making sure that to achieve a result you have to make the fewest number of
> clicks.

### Extra points

Do you dare to use other types of less common units of measurement? Apart from the typical units, there are many others
that we could include in our app. From soccer fields to kilometers converter, or a beard/seconds converter. Don't put
that face, it exists. 

You have the freedom of creativity, let's see what you can surprise us with!

## Technical requirements

* Create a **clean**, **maintainable** and **well-designed** code. We expect to see a good and clear architecture that
  allows to add or modify the solution without so much troubles.
* **Test** your code until you are comfortable with it. We don't expect a 100% of Code Coverage but some tests that
  helps to have a more stable and confident base code.

To understand how you take decisions during the implementation, **please write a COMMENTS.md** file explaining some of
the most important parts of the application. You would also be able to defend your code through
[Rviewer](https://rviewer.io), once you submit your solution.

## How to submit your solution

* Push your code to the `devel` branch - we encourage you to commit regularly to show your thinking process was.
* **Create a new Pull Request** to `main` branch & **merge it**.

Once merged you **won't be able to change or add** anything to your solution, so double-check that everything is as you
expected!

Remember that **there is no countdown**, so take your time and implement a solution that you are proud!
